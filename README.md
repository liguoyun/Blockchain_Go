This is actually the clone from https://github.com/Jeiwan/blockchain_go.

The detail steps and explanations are on https://jeiwan.cc/tags/blockchain/.

I created a project in local disk, copied the source code from the above branches, then tested and verified step by step.

The targetBits has been changed from 24 to 8, so the caculation now is pretty faster than the origional version in my laptop.
